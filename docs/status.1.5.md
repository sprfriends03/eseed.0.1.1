  - Complete business logic: KYC verification, conflict detection, payment integration

### Phase 3: Testing Implementation ✅
- **route/membership_test.go**: Comprehensive test coverage
  - 5 test suites covering security, integration, and functionality
  - All 21 tests passing (8 auth + 8 kyc + 5 membership)
  - Security validation for all 9 endpoints
  - Route registration and compilation verification

## Feature Implementation Status ✅
