## Requirements Implemented

### 1. User Model Extensions ✅
- Added `DateOfBirth` field with YYYY-MM-DD format
- Added `EmailVerifiedAt` timestamp for email verification tracking
- Added `PrivacyPreferences` structure for profile visibility controls

- `PermissionUserPrivacySelf`: Manage privacy settings

### 4. API Endpoints ✅

#### Profile Management
- `GET /profile/v1` - Get authenticated user's profile
- `PUT /profile/v1` - Update authenticated user's profile
- `GET /profile/v1/privacy` - Get privacy settings
- `PUT /profile/v1/privacy` - Update privacy settings
- `GET /profile/v1/public/:user_id` - Get public profile (respects privacy settings)

#### Profile Picture Management
- `POST /profile/v1/picture` - Upload profile picture
- `DELETE /profile/v1/picture` - Delete profile picture

#### Account Management
- `DELETE /profile/v1/account` - Delete user account (soft delete)

### 5. Storage Integration ✅
- Profile pictures stored in MinIO under "profile-images" bucket
- Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP formats
- Automatic file cleanup on account deletion

### 6. Member Registration Enhancement ✅
- Age verification ensures users are 18+ years old
- Date of birth validation and parsing
- Integration with existing member registration flow

## Technical Details

### Data Models
```go
type UserDomain struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    DateOfBirth        *time.Time       `json:"date_of_birth,omitempty"`
    EmailVerifiedAt    *time.Time       `json:"email_verified_at,omitempty"`
    PrivacyPreferences *PrivacySettings `json:"privacy_preferences,omitempty"`
    ProfilePicture     *string          `json:"profile_picture,omitempty"`
}

type PrivacySettings struct {
    ShowEmail          *bool `json:"show_email,omitempty"`
    ShowPhone          *bool `json:"show_phone,omitempty"`
    ShowDateOfBirth    *bool `json:"show_date_of_birth,omitempty"`
    ShowName           *bool `json:"show_name,omitempty"`
    ShowProfilePicture *bool `json:"show_profile_picture,omitempty"`
    IsPublic           *bool `json:"is_public,omitempty"`
}
```

### Security Features
- All endpoints require proper authentication
- Permission-based access control
- Privacy settings respected in public profile views
- Root users cannot delete their accounts
- Profile pictures validated for proper image formats

### File Management
- Profile pictures stored with timestamp prefixes for uniqueness
- Automatic content-type detection based on file extensions
- Graceful handling of storage errors
- Cleanup of orphaned files during account deletion

## Testing Status
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Passes static analysis (go vet)
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All new routes registered properly

## Next Steps
- Integration testing with frontend
- End-to-end testing with real user flows
- Performance testing for file uploads
- Documentation updates for API consumers
