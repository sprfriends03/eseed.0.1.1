# Performance Testing Plan - Profile Picture Upload

## Overview
This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the profile picture upload functionality implemented in Task 1.3: Member Management.

## Testing Objectives
1. **Throughput Testing**: Measure maximum concurrent uploads the system can handle
2. **Latency Testing**: Measure upload response times under various loads
3. **Resource Utilization**: Monitor server CPU, memory, and storage during uploads
4. **Scalability Testing**: Determine system behavior under increasing load
5. **Error Rate Analysis**: Identify failure points and error conditions

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Baseline Performance Test
**Objective**: Establish baseline performance metrics
- **Load**: Single user, single file upload
- **File Sizes**: 100KB, 500KB, 1MB, 5MB, 10MB
- **File Types**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Metrics**: Response time, success rate, resource usage

### 2. Concurrent User Test
**Objective**: Test system performance with multiple simultaneous uploads
- **Load**: 10, 25, 50, 100 concurrent users
- **File Size**: Fixed at 2MB (realistic profile picture size)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes per load level
- **Metrics**: Average response time, 95th percentile response time, error rate

### 3. File Size Stress Test
**Objective**: Determine maximum file size handling capacity
- **Load**: Single user

## Test Environment Setup

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Application Server**: Go application with profile upload endpoints
- **Storage**: MinIO server configured for profile-images bucket
- **Database**: MongoDB for user metadata
- **Load Generator**: Artillery.js or Apache JMeter

### Test Data Preparation
```bash
# Create test images of various sizes
for size in 100k 500k 1m 5m 10m; do
  convert -size 800x600 xc:blue test_image_${size}.jpg
done

# Create user accounts for testing
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/v1/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"username\":\"testuser${i}\",\"password\":\"Test123!\",\"keycode\":\"test_club\"}"
done
```

## Performance Test Scripts

### Artillery.js Configuration
```yaml
config:
  target: 'http://localhost:3000'
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 1
      name: "Warm up"
    - duration: 120
      arrivalRate: 10
      name: "Ramp up load"
    - duration: 300
      arrivalRate: 25
      name: "Sustained load"
  processor: "./test-functions.js"

scenarios:
  - name: "Profile Picture Upload"
    weight: 100
    flow:
      - post:
          url: "/auth/v1/login"
          json:
            username: "{{ $randomString() }}"
            password: "Test123!"
            keycode: "test_club"
          capture:
            json: "$.access_token"
            as: "token"
      - post:
          url: "/profile/v1/picture"
          headers:
            Authorization: "Bearer {{ token }}"
          formData:
            file: "@./test_image_2m.jpg"
```

### JMeter Test Plan Elements
1. **Thread Group**: Configure user load patterns
2. **HTTP Request**: Profile picture upload endpoint
3. **Authentication**: Bearer token setup
4. **File Upload**: Multipart form data configuration
5. **Listeners**: Response time graphs, throughput reports

## Metrics to Collect

### Application Metrics
- **Response Time**: Average, median, 95th percentile, 99th percentile
- **Throughput**: Requests per second, uploads per minute
- **Error Rate**: HTTP 4xx/5xx error percentage
- **Concurrent Users**: Maximum sustainable load

### System Metrics
- **CPU Utilization**: Application server CPU usage
- **Memory Usage**: Heap usage, garbage collection frequency
- **Network I/O**: Bandwidth utilization, packet loss
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write operations, storage latency

### Storage Metrics (MinIO)
- **Upload Latency**: Time to store files in MinIO
- **Storage Throughput**: MB/s upload rate
