### Summary

Task 1.1 has been successfully completed. The core infrastructure for the cannabis club management platform is now in place, including:

1. MongoDB collection schemas with proper relationships and indexing
2. Enhanced error handling framework with cannabis-specific error codes
3. Test infrastructure with mock services and helper utilities
4. Configuration and setup for Redis and MinIO storage

All infrastructure components have been implemented following the project's coding patterns and architectural guidelines, providing a solid foundation for the next development phases.

### Issues
