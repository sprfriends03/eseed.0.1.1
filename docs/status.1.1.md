### Current Status
Task 1.1 is now complete. All core infrastructure components are set up and functioning correctly. This includes:

1. MongoDB configuration with proper connection pooling and error handling
2. Redis configuration with caching strategy and key patterns
3. MinIO storage with appropriate buckets and access controls
4. Error handling framework with domain-specific error codes
5. Testing framework with mock services and helpers

### Remaining Tasks (Phase 1.2)

- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Database schema documentation
- [ ] Configuration guide
- [ ] Development setup guide
- [ ] Performance test suite
- [ ] Security validation (TLS/SSL, CORS settings)

### Known Issues

- Need to install required Go packages before building the project
- Performance test suite not yet implemented as it will be addressed in a future phase
