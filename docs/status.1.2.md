# Task 1.2: Authentication & Authorization for Members - Status

## Overall Status
- [ ] **Not Started**
- [ ] **Planning Phase**
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Testing
- [X] **Completed**
- [ ] Deployed

## Current Progress
- Core member authentication and authorization features implemented.
- Extended OAuth system for member registration, login, and email verification.
- Integrated JWT handling with member-specific claims (MembershipID, MembershipStatus, KYCStatus).
- Implemented member status validation (KYC, age, membership) in the login flow.
- Added security enhancements: standard security headers and stricter rate limiting for member login.
- Developed initial unit tests for member registration.
- Updated API documentation (Swagger annotations) and regenerated docs.
- Linter errors resolved across modified files.
- Note: Advanced features (RS256, key rotation, refresh token families, progressive backoff), comprehensive testing (full flows, advanced security tests), and detailed developer guides were deferred for future consideration.

- [X] 1.2.3 Tune Security Enhancements for Members (100% - Core Done, advanced items deferred as noted in tasks.1.2.md)
    - [X] Security Headers (100%)
    - [X] Rate Limiting (Tuned for member login - Core Done)
    - [X] Audit Logging (Utilizing existing mechanisms) (100%)

## Blockers/Issues
- None. Core requirements of Task 1.2 are complete. Deferred items logged in `docs/tasks.1.2.md`.

## Next Actions
1.  Proceed with Task 1.3: Member Management System Integration.
2.  Review deferred items from Task 1.2 (advanced security, comprehensive testing, developer guides) for scheduling as future enhancements or separate tasks.

## Recent Updates
- 2023-06-07 (Previous): Created initial implementation plan and status tracking; Analyzed existing code.
- 2023-06-07 (Previous): Refined implementation plan in `docs/tasks.1.2.md` to remove external OAuth and SSL. Further refined plan to clearly delineate member-specific extensions versus leveraging existing user authentication mechanisms. Updated this status file accordingly.
- {{YYYY-MM-DD}} (Today's Date): Completed core implementation for Task 1.2. Member authentication flows, JWT handling, essential security measures, initial tests, and API documentation are in place. Advanced features and exhaustive testing/documentation deferred. System ready for Task 1.3.
