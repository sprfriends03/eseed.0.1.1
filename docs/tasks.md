# Seed eG Platform Tasks

This document outlines the key implementation tasks for the Seed eG Platform's MVP development phase.

## Current Tasks

### Task 1.2: Authentication & Authorization

The detailed implementation plan is in [tasks.1.2.md](tasks.1.2.md).

#### Overview
This task involves extending the existing authentication system to support member-specific authentication, implement JWT token handling, and enhance security. Building on the existing OAuth system, we'll add support for member authentication, configure OAuth providers, and implement robust token management.

#### Key Implementation Areas
1. **Extend Existing OAuth System**
   - Implement member-specific authentication flows
   - Configure OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, Apple)
   - Establish token management for members

2. **JWT Token Handling**
   - Implement token generation logic with member-specific claims
   - Create refresh token mechanism with secure storage in Redis
   - Develop token validation middleware with role-based access control

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Configure security headers for authentication endpoints
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Set up comprehensive audit logging

#### Dependencies
- Requires completion of Task 1.1 (Core Infrastructure Setup)
- Needs OAuth provider credentials
- Requires SSL certificates for secure authentication

#### Timeline
- Expected duration: 1-2 weeks
- Target completion: [TBD]
