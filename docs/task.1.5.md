# Task 1.5: Membership Management System

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

## Objective
Implement comprehensive membership management system as an extension of the existing Member system, providing manual admin-controlled membership creation, renewal, and lifecycle management with full audit trails and integration with the existing Member and User models.

## Implementation Strategy
**Maximize Code Reuse**: This implementation leverages the existing `MembershipDomain` model, authentication infrastructure, member system (task 1.3), eKYC system (task 1.4), error handling, and database patterns to minimize new code and maintain architectural consistency. Manual payment processing will be handled through admin dashboard interfaces.

## Architecture Overview

### Current Infrastructure Analysis âœ… COMPLETED
**Existing Components Successfully Identified:**
- âœ… `MembershipDomain` model exists in `store/db/membership.go` with complete CRUD operations
- âœ… Member model has `CurrentMembershipID` field linking to memberships
- âœ… Authentication system supports membership status validation via `RequireMembershipStatus` middleware
- âœ… Error handling includes comprehensive membership-specific error codes in `pkg/ecode/cannabis.go`
- âœ… Audit logging system ready for membership operations
- âœ… Base permission system needs extension for membership management permissions
